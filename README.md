# FTNoise
A paper on how to set audio levels for Ham operators for all modes of computer operations.
This includes all digital modes...FT8/FT4/RTTY/PSK/...etc....
One level setting and all the modes will work without harmonics being generated and without the need to change anything between different programs.
For example FLDigi you will need to adjust FLDigi's spectrum display for the lower level we need to use.
The method describied should work on any rig.
